# Orphan_SweetHome

## Project Description
#### Problems we are facing

* [x] Statistics from Johns Hopkins University show that the cumulative number of deaths in the United States is approaching one million. Many of those who have died are the parents or primary caregivers of children who have become "orphans of the new strain".

* [x] Statistics from Imperial College in the United Kingdom show that as of early April 2022, approximately 197,000 minors under the age of 18 in the United States have lost at least one of both parents to the COVID-19 Global Pandemic; close to 250,000 children have lost their primary or secondary guardians to the Pandemic. The Atlantic Monthly article cites data showing that one in 12 orphans under the age of 18 in the United States will lose a guardian in the Pandemic.

* [x] According to the Pew Research Center, mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, trauma and depression are on the rise among "COVID-19 affected orphans," so it is important to create a system of sweet home for orphans to help them get out of the physical and mental gloom and find warm families to adopt.

#### Solutions
* [x] We combine these problems together and provide a system that makes the process of adopting stray orphans easy and convenient with **Java Swing** .
* [x] The purpose of our system is to make sure the orphan is healthy both mentally and physically and verify the adopter is qualified before accessing the orphan's information at the same time. We also provide the opportunity to volunteer and the volunteers could process their work independently.
* [x] We consider the use case from medical checkers, volunteers, and adopters. At the same time, with the use case of system administrator, this system is expandable at the global level. 
* [x] Every orphan is responsible by a single manager, the manager is permitted to have an overview of an orphan.
